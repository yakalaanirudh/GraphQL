GraphQL is a query language.

GraphQL acts as a layer between our front-end and back-end.
Query languages like SQL act between back-end and the databse.
This is the main difference between GRaphQL and Query Languages.

In GraphQL GET is a query and PUT,POST,DELETE are Mutations.

GraphQL works in the following way.
    The front end communicates to GraphQL which communicates to the back end.


REST has multiple end points but in GraphQL has only one end point.
REST 

Users{

}

Followers{

}

Posts{

}

GraphQL

{
    User{

    }
    Followers{

    }
    Posts{

    }
}

In REST  we either overfetch or underfetch
In REST Since we have 3 different objects we make three different queries(under fetching).
But if we put all the data in one object then we fetch all the data(over fetching)

But in GraphQL since there is only on end point we make only request specifying what we want specifically 
so no over/under fetching.

With REST we do something like we make the backend determine what data the front end wants.
With GraphQL the front end telld GraphQL what it wants and then GraphQl tells backend.
